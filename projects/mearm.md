I was planning on building a robotic arm at some point but didn't have any concrete plans.  After reading a [book on the Johnny Five platform](https://www.amazon.co.uk/JavaScript-Robotics-Johnny-Five-Raspberry-BeagleBone-ebook/dp/B00W2ILK7U) I was considering building something super-cheap with lollypop sticks - then I stumbled upon the MeArm open source robotic arm.  The retail price for the basic kit was a bit beyond what I was looking to spend that month but I liked the look of the arm enough to bookmark it and thought I'd have a quick look on eBay in case I could find one cheaper.  By pure chance, someone was selling the acrylic parts for a stupidly low price and I knew I had the hardware and servos to complete the build so I purchased the item on the spot.

This project is a record of the build followed by the things I learn and any modifications I make.
