I discovered [Ben Eater's excellent Youtube series on building an 8-bit computer](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU) from logic ICs and decided to build my own, partly for fun but also to improve my knowledge and understanding of the inner workings of computers.  I won't post details of every stage of the build here as much of it, at least initially, would just be reproducing his work without the quality and thoroughness of his presentation.  I will, however, post anything where I differ from his build as well as any future improvements I make.
