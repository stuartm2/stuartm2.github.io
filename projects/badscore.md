We play badminton with a couple of friends every week. It’s great fun but we’re
all getting older and keeping track of the score is becoming more difficult!
More realistically, we just get stuck into the game and, with some rallys taking
a while to win and requiring considerable physical effort, it’s not unusual for
some or all of us to have forgotten what the scores were by the time we need
them. Then there are those occasions where everyone thinks they remember what
the score is, but we all come up with different numbers. Anyway, this seems like
the kind of problem which could be solved with an Arduino ...
