With the demise of my MPCNC, and being too tight-fisted to fork-out for an X-Carve or similar, I'm going the homebrew route for my new CNC router.  It'll be used for cutting sheet material like fibreglass, acrylic, plywood, etc. so it must be rigid and have a reasonably large cutting area but won't need much z-axis movement.  The plan is to use the electronics from my MPCNC wherever possible but to build a new frame and lead-screw driven axes.
