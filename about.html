<p>I'm a web developer and hacker/maker with a fairly broad range of interests including:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Remote control planes, multicopters and cars</li>
    <li>Mine exploration</li>
    <li>3D printing</li>
    <li>Electronics</li>
    <li>Photography</li>
    <li><a href="http://quantifiedself.com">Quantified Self</a></li>
    <li>Running, cycling and staying in shape</li>
</ul>

<p>I like to combine these interests as much as possible, for instance making my own miniature underground quadcopter for mine exploration and photography.  This site is the place where I intend to document my various projects, both for posterity and to share my experiences and discoveries with others.</p>
