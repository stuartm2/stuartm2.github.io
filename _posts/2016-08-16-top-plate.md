The first plate is cut.  It was a bit more of a pain than I expected as the milling bit, while effective at cutting through the glassfibre sheet, was quite short-lived.  It cut the holes and inner shapes but wasn't able to complete the outer shape.  Thankfully, it did cut a shallow groove all round so I was able to finish it off easily with the Dremel and some hand tools.  It's not as neat as I'd have liked but it'll do the job just fine.  Here's the finished item:

Here it is with the arms and retracting skids fitted:

And here it is with the old bottom plate, the new camera gimbal and the battery to see how it's all going to go together:

I have some other milling bits to try with this fibreglass sheet which might have more longevity.  I also have some 3D printed parts to design and print so there should be some more progress on this over the next few days.
