Took a quick trip into town after work to buy a big sheet of 6mm MDF then dusted off Fran's old band saw, cut the top and bottom plates to the specified sizes and drilled the holes for the support screws.  I won't be able to drill the holes in the bottom plate for the bearing holders until the linear bearings arrive and I also need to order some 40mm M3 machine screws on ebay.  I was able to fit and align the Y-axis smooth rods as the "heavy-duty" printed plastic clamps have separate screws to hold the rods in place, enabling me to safely position the brackets and still remove the rods later to fit the bearings.
