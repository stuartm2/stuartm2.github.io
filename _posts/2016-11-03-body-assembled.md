I finished the legs a couple of weeks ago and have been waiting for a sheet of 3mm perspex to arrive so I could cut the body plates.  That arrived the other day and, after tweaking the CNC router, I got down to cutting!  There were a few failures along the way as I worked out what settings to use to cut perspex sheet - thankfully I anticipated this and ordered more than I needed!  Anyway, the plates are done and look great:

I also designed a neck to hold the original camera support and redesigned the body separators to attach with M3 hardware to work with the new plates.  Here it is loosely assembled:

I'm still working out the details of the PCB production which might take a while and I won't be getting the Raspberry Pi or a few other things I'll need to finish this build until the end of this month so don't expect any major updates for a while.
