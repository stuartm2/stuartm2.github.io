While I wait for the steel plate to do the major nearside front repairs from yesterday, I decided to carry on with the main chassis rail repairs on the offside.  Starting at the front and working back, here's the next hole cut back to good steel.  You can see the [first small repair on this side]({% post_url 2015-02-23-a-second-small-patch %}) on the right and just about make out the old patch weld on the left which I mention at the end of this post.

I needed to bend the plate to make it fit neatly but I was pretty pleased with the eventual fit.  From this photo, you can see the side weld (between rail top and rail side) which I was pleased with.  I wasn't quite so pleased with the massive hole I blew in the top, however - current was too high for the thickness of steel.  As it's quite close to the next repair, I've decided to just patch the entire length so I didn't bother trying to clean it up today.

Here's the side weld on the inside (even neater than the outside):

And from the top:

Finally, this is the mess which was lurking under the patch I mentioned the other day and is what I'll be working on next.
