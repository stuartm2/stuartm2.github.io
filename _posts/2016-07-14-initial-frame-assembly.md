Well, our Maker Month didn't quite work out as planned - illness, family commitments and a blocked printer nozzle all colluded to result in very little being done so we've started again ...

With the frame parts finally printed, I was able to work out roughly how large I want the work area to be and cut the various tubes to length.  The photo below shows the frame loosely assembled to confirm everything fits.  Nothing's been screwed down or bolted together yet and the wooden base is just an old bit of worktop offcut which is quite badly warped so it will need to be replaced with something more suitable before final assembly.  With the exception of the roller clamps, which are going to require a little 'encouragement' to fit the X and Y tubes, it all looks like it'll bolt together very nicely.
