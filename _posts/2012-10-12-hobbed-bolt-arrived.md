The hobbed bolt arrived in the post this morning.  At first glance, I thought it was hobbed in the wrong place but it turns out that it fits perfectly if you flip it over and seat the nut rather than the bolt in the large gear.  I was planning on using a nyloc nut so found this slightly odd because it looks like the motor could loosen the nut if it jams while trying to reverse.  I guess there's not enough torque to do that, or the hob will slip on the filament first, or something.  Anyway, I changed my mind and used two regular nuts to lock against each other instead, which should avoid any such problems.

I have a short length of ABS filament which I used to test the feed and everything seems to work well with the filament still feeding when I apply a reasonable amount of pressure to it with my fingers.  Here's the finished extruder body, just waiting for the motor and hot-end next month.
