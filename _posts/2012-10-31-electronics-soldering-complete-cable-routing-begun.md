The remaining parts turned up from Farnell this morning along with the M2 hardware and the Pololu stepper driver modules from China (super-fast shipping!!).  So, this evening saw me finishing the soldering, properly fitting the microswitches and routing the end stop cables.  I also got an email from Farnell earlier telling me that the Atmels are now in stock so I should be receiving those any day.  Then it'll be time to dust off the AVR programmer and get down to the serious business of loading the firmware and testing the board.

This build is really starting to come together now!  The only major outstanding items are the stepper motors and the J-Head extruder hot-end which should both be here no later than the middle of the month.  Other than that, it'll just be the odd connector or some hardware if I find I need it during final assembly.

Here's a close-up of the finished board.  I haven't fitted the Pololu heatsinks yet but I do have them.
