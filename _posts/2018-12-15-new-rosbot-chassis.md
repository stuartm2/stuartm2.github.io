The first part of this project is the chassis and non-drive components.  The extrusions are 240mm lengths of 2020 T-slot with 6mm channels, making ROSbot a bit smaller than the Scuttle robot it's based on.  The extrusions are connected in the corners with some 3D-printed brackets from Thingiverse.

The front wheels are a pair of heavy duty 40mm casters with rubber tyres which should be plenty strong enough and provide good grip on my tiled floors.

I'm going to try using 35mm DIN rails to mount the electronics.  I've never worked with these before but they look like they could be quite useful for future projects.  They're mounted with some brackets from Thingiverse for now but I may review where the rails are mounted later in the project.

Here's the assembled chassis:
