It's time to upgrade ROSbot.  It needs a larger frame to accommodate a Kinect sensor and more powerful motors to drive the extra weight around.

Inspired by the [Scuttle mobile utility robot project on Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/112547/scuttle-mobile-utility-robot-from-texas-a-m-d6c2b7), I'm going to use some short 2020 T-slot extrusions I salvaged from [an old 3D printer](/projects/kossel-mini.html) for the chassis.  The drive system will (hopefully) use a couple of spare brushless motors.  Here's a photo of the Scuttle robot to show the direction I'm going with this:
