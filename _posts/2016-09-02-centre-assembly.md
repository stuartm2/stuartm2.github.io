The component mounts are now designed and printed so the quadcopter should now be ready for assembly and testing.  The mounts are designed to attach to the bottom main plate on the rear and both sides and will hold the following components:

R/H side:

 * External USB/LED
 * Video switcher
 * Video transmitter

L/H side:

 * GPS antenna
 * Radio telemetry transceiver

Rear:

 * Radio receiver

Here are the printed parts and most of the components, ready to assemble:

And here are a few shots of the completed centre assembly including the camera gimbal and speed controller.

I haven't decided what to do with the power module yet but it can be left floating free for now.  So the next stage is to finish wiring up the electronics, re-configure the flight controller and get it up in the air for a short test flight to assess stability and responsiveness.
