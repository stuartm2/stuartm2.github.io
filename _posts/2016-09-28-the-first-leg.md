The servos and other leg hardware arrived and I've printed the various parts (coxa, femurs and tibia) over the past few days.  The original tibia was a bit too long to fit on my 200mm diameter printbed so I had to remove some of the cosmetic extension at the top using Meshmixer:

During assembly, I also found some of the hardware parts to attach the back side of the servo were a bit off - the specified 4x8x4 bearings were too small for the 10mm hole in the femur and I think I should have ordered penny washers rather than regular ones - so I decided to design and print a simple bearing retainer which glues into the femur rather than ordering new parts.  Here's the finished first leg:

Only five more to go ...

I've uploaded [my custom parts](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1796312) to Thingiverse in case they prove useful to anyone else.
