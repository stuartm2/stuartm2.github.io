With the last of the middle section parts printed last week, it was time to assemble it.  There was a fair amount of fettling needed to get the bearings to fit the rails - they were too tight in the horizontal axes and too loose in the vertical.  I'm not sure if this was a result of the models or bad settings on my printer but everything seems fine now.

Here's the assembled middle section next to my workshop mug to give a sense of scale.  It's a nice, solid item that looks like it'll stand up to some abuse.
