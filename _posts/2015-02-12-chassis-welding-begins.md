With the weather improving enough to make it almost habitable in the workshop, I decided to get on with the welding. The nice big square hole in the front crossmember seemed like a good place to start:

The hole needed some cleanup with the air chisel, file and flappy disc but it now has reasonably good edges all round.  Using a quick cardboard template, I cut the patch out of 2.5mm mild steel plate and gave it a chamfer all round to help with weld penetration.  With the patch magnetically clamped, I tacked it in place:

The top and bottom of the chassis are a little thin at the edges and there's some blow-through on the top welds which is probably due to me having the welder turned up too high.  I'll see how it goes with a lower current when I do the full weld but I may end up having to put in some extra patches on the top and bottom if the edges are too thin.

Here's the work area:
