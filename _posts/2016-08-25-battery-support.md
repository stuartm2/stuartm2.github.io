Following a couple of tweaks to my original design, I've now finished the battery support on the top plate.  This consists of 2 printed end pieces with up-turned sides to keep the battery aligned, a printed central piece to provide a solid platform for the battery to be strapped against and two pieces of neoprene rubber in the gaps which sit proud of the plastic parts and stop it sliding back and forth.  Here's a photo of everything assembled:

And here's a photo of the battery in place:

There are no publicly available models for now but I'll be publishing everything when it's finished.  The next stage is the bottom plates which are currently being designed.
