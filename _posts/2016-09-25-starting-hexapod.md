With the [quadcopter](/projects/quadx450.html) close to completion, I've started looking at my next project - something fun for the autumn and winter nights.  Last year I made a start on [a 2-wheeled robot]({% post_url 2015-11-28-start-ros-2-wheeled-robot %}) to learn about ROS but that project stalled and my mate Dave has since told me about a cool hexapod project based on ROS called [Antdroid](http://antdroid.mooo.com) which seems like a great entry to ROS.  So I'm going to build one of those now and come back to the 2-wheeled robot later, once I'm more familiar with ROS.

Of course, it's never quite that simple.  A few of the parts are too large for my printbed so I'm going to need to either adapt or redesign those, and I'm going to go the [custom PCB route](https://github.com/antdroid-hexapod/antdroid-board) rather than use a load of separate components so I'll need to make some major improvements to my PCB production capabilities.
