Fran and I are having a "maker month" where we spend every weekday evening in the workshop rather than in front of the TV.  Today is Day 1 and my first project is a ["Mostly Printed CNC"](http://www.vicious1.com/specifications/).  The big time-sink in this project is going to be the printing so I got a bit of a head start over the past couple of weeks printing most of the bigger parts.  This evening's task was assembling the X and Y rollers which included drilling out the M8 holes and a little filing to angle some of the bearing supports slightly to ensure a good fit against the rail.

Here are the four rollers completed and temporarily in place on one of the rails:
