I decided to make a start on the X-axis today, using the 20mm T-slot extrusion as the rail which the Z-axis will travel along.  To make it sufficiently rigid (hopefully), I'm using all three lengths of the extrusion together.  As I'll be keeping the Y-axis parts from the MPCNC, the bulk of the work on this was on fabricating a pair of right angle brackets to attach the X-axis rail to the Y-axis runners securely.  I have a stack of 3.5mm angled plate which will be ideal for this job so I knocked together a design, measured and marked everything and got down to business.  Here's the result:

And here it is in place with the tapped lengths of extrusion in place:

This will give me somewhere around my intended 400mm working width and does seem very sturdy although I'm going to need to bolt the three extrusions together to ensure it's as rigid as possible.  This new design will also enable me to cut the vertical frame legs right down which will stiffen the frame even more.
