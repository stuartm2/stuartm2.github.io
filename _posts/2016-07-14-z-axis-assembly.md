Hot on the heels of yesterday's assembly, today is the turn of the z-axis.  The nut holders from the official parts were too wide for the internal diameter of my tubing and the nut cavities were too large so [I designed my own](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1673377) over lunch and printed them this afternoon.  The threaded rod is salvaged from my old Prusa i2.

I've used the default tool mount for now but it won't fit my rotary tool and I haven't found anything suitable on Thingiverse so I'll likely end up designing my own at some point.  I decided not to use the coupler from the official parts so ordered an aluminium one online instead.
