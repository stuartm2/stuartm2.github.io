A change of pace initially, today.  Instead of big lumps of plate, I had to patch a small curved area in the top of the steering relay tunnel.  I cut a piece of 0.8mm sheet from an old offcut, cleaned it up, cut it to size and shaped it to fit the gap.  Welding was tricky because I had trouble getting in to clean up the edges and because it's an awkward shape so it's quite rough and blobby.  Even after a cleanup with a file, it's not pretty but the relay fits through without obstruction so I'm happy enough with it.

Rather than cut a single plate for the top with a hole in the middle, I figured it'd be easier to do it in two halves so I cut the first one today and welded it in place.  It fits pretty nicely and any gaps between the plate and the tunnel responded well to a quick hammering against the chamfer I cut in the plate.  As a side note, I'm pretty pleased with the welds on this one too.
