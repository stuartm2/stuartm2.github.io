Having been slightly distracted by making [the step for the pit]({% post_url 2015-02-21-inspection-pit-step %}) and then running out of welding wire, what I expected to be done on Monday of last week finally ended up being finished today instead.  The top edge, while thin, didn't blow through but the bottom edge was too thin (and due to its location, likely to suffer worse with corrosion in the future) so I stuck a small patch underneath to reinforce it.  Weld penetration looks good; the resulting beads were particularly blobby, especially the ones underneath, so I ground them flush.

Here it is before:
