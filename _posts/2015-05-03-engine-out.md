The new engine crane arrived last week so today was the day to remove the engine.

I had to clean out the threads for the lifting brackets to bolt into, remove a few remaining bolts and cut the exhaust pipe, but other than that it came out easily.  The arm is ''just'' long enough at full extent.

The chassis is now back over the pit, up on stands (at the front) and ready to do any remaining welding and patching on the inner sides.

Some more good news: the engine crossmember, which I was a bit concerned about, seems to be in good condition.
