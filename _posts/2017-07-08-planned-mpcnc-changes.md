Since I built this router last year, it hasn't really performed as well as I'd hoped.  Aside from some software and communication issues (which I could resolve with a little effort), the main issue has been a lack of rigidity in the central tool mount.  This has made using the router for projects a somewhat uninviting prospect as I tend to spend lots of money on materials like Perspex and fibreglass sheet which then get destroyed by a random kickback from the cutting tool half way through the job.  I've let the situation ride for a while but now I want to work on something which is going to require reliability from my router so it needs sorting.

There are various upgrades designed to improve the rigidity of the central tool mount but I'm not convinced that continuing with the current design is the best option for me considering my usage requirements, so I've been considering other options.  The gantry-style desktop routers (OX, X-Carve, etc.) look much sturdier but I can't afford to spend the money on something like that.  There are some fairly reasonably priced kits on eBay at a more affordable price but, on closer inspection, I suspect those within my budget would prove unsatisfactory.  That leaves me with the custom option (which has the added bonus of being a fun project!).  I think I can reuse parts of the existing router and I should have enough bits lying around from old projects that I'll be able to build something solid for relatively little money with some hand-fabrication of metal plates and some 3D printing.

While I'm at it, I'm going to complete some planned improvements including reducing the work area to around 400mm x 300mm so it's a genuine 'desktop' unit, hiding the electronics in the base and improving cable management with some cable chains.

Beyond the general direction, my designs are a little loose at the moment.  The Z-axis will definitely be getting replaced by something influenced by the gantry-style routers I mentioned above and will use the big chunky spindle holder supplied by the manufacturer.  I'm considering keeping the MPCNC Y-axis rails as they seem rigid enough and will save me some time and money.  The X-axis, however, is going to need a bit of a rethink.  I have some 20x20 T-slot extrusion of the right length and some matching V-rollers lying around so I'm thinking of using those initially to see if they're rigid enough.

Watch this space ...
