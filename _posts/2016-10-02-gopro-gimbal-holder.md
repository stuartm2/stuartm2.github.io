With this build coming to a close, I've been getting down to the final tweaking, testing and tuning.  One thing I found while doing this is that the holder for the GoPro clone is awkward to use so I decided to have a re-think.  Based on the clip-in holder supplied with the camera, I designed [a new holder](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1802885) which re-uses part of the gimbal's original camera support but allows easy insertion and removal of the camera without risking an accidental press of a button, and which also holds the camera securely.  Here are a couple of photos of the finished item:
