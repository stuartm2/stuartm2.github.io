Sad news ... It has become painfully obvious that the chassis needs more money and time throwing at it than I have to offer.  Regardless of how much I convince myself that I *can* do it, I've had to make the difficult decision that I *won't* do it - at least not any time soon - and I need to make the mental and physical room available for other things.  So the Land Rover has gone to a new home where it will (hopefully) be given a new life.
