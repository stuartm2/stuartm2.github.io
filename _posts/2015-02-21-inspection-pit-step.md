I needed to get under the chassis so the time has come to remove the old doors currently functioning as a pit cover.  This does, however, mean that I'll have a rather treacherous gap at the front of the pit in which to place my unwary feet.  I've cobbled together a quick step from some scrap steel and a bit of wood I had lying around.  This will provide a safe surface to stand on.  It's only intended as a temporary measure so I don't intend to clean it up or paint it.

Here it is in-situ:

Here's the main frame:

A couple of close-ups of the welding (I was particularly pleased with the long beads):
