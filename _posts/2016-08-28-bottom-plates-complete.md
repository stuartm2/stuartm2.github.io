The rest of the fibreglass bottom plates are now finished.  Here they are, fresh from the CNC router:

Here are a few photos of the quadcopter loosely assembled with all the new plates so I can see how everything goes together:

The overlapping layers make assembly a bit complicated.  I have to work from the gimbal upwards to ensure I can get at all the screws but once this is finished, I'm hoping I won't have to disassemble it again any time soon.

I still have some design work to do on the plastic parts which will hold the various electronic components in place and I need to order some hardware to complete the build but we're in the final stretch now ...
